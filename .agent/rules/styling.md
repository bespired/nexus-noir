# Styling Rules

- **NO TAILWIND CSS**: Do not use Tailwind CSS utility classes in this project. The user finds them bloated and unnecessary.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Use standard CSS in scoped `<style>` blocks within Vue components.
- **Modern CSS**: Feel free to use modern CSS features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS variables, but keep them in the component's style block or global CSS files.
- **Aesthetics**: Maintain the "Nexus Noir" aesthetic—dark, premium, neon-accented, and high-tech—using vanilla CSS.
